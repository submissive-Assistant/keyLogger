## How to Acquire the Google Drive Service Account Key JSON File

1. **Go to the Google Cloud Console**:  
   Visit: https://console.cloud.google.com/

2. **Create a New Project**:  
   - Click on the **"Select a project"** dropdown.
   - Click on **"New Project"**.
   - Enter the project name and click **"Create"**.

3. **Enable the Google Drive API**:  
   - In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to **APIs & Services** > **Library**.
   - Search for **"Google Drive API"**.
   - Click on it and enable the API for your project.

4. **Create a Service Account**:  
   - In the left sidebar, go to **IAM & Admin** > **Service Accounts**.
   - Click on **"Create Service Account"**.
   - Enter a service account name and description, then click **"Create"**.
   - Grant any necessary roles (e.g., **Project > Editor**) and click **"Continue"**.

5. **Generate the Key File**:  
   - In the Service Account details page, go to the **Keys** tab.
   - Click on **"Add Key"** > **"Create New Key"**.
   - Choose **JSON** as the key type and click **"Create"**.
   - This will download a JSON file to your system (`your-key.json`).

   - Move the downloaded JSON file to the same folder where your project files are located.
